  <hr>
  <p>My reason why I chose MIS was because of several reasons. My first reason for choosing this major was because this was the major that my boss at work suggested. For the longest time, I was indecisive about what major I wanted to do. I knew that I wanted to study business but was not sure what part of business I wanted to go into. When I was talking about this with my boss, he suggested trying MIS and that it will be an “interesting expirience.” Even though i’m not really a computer person, i thought that I should give it a try. Also, I wanted to know what he meant when saying that I will have an “intresting expirience.” My second reason for choosing this major was because I thought that this major will be useful in the future. There was a part of me that wanted to kind of learn about IT. However, because I’m not confident in IT, I choose MIS which was a mixture of business and IT.</p>
